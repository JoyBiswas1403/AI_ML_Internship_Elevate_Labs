# 🧬 Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression – AI & ML Internship

**Name:** Joy Biswas

---

## 📚 Overview

This task builds a binary classifier using **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

- 📥 Loaded the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset
- ➗ Splitted the data into training and testing sets (stratified 80-20 split)
- ⚖️ Standardized all features to mean 0 and variance 1
- 🤖 Trained a Logistic Regression classifier using scikit-learn
- 🏷️ Predicted and evaluated performance using:
    - Confusion Matrix
    - Precision & Recall scores
    - ROC Curve & ROC-AUC value
- 🎚 Tuned probability threshold and visualized the sigmoid function
- 💾 Saved the cleaned dataset and all visualizations for documentation

## 📝 Key Evaluation Metrics

- **Precision:** How many predicted positives are actually positive  
- **Recall:** How many actual positives are identified correctly  
- **ROC-AUC:** Model’s ability to distinguish between classes  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Counts of true/false positives and negatives
