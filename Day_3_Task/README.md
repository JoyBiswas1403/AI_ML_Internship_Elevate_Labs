# 🏠 Task 3: Linear Regression – Boston Housing Price Prediction

**Name:** Joy Biswas

---

## 📋 Overview

This task implements a multiple linear regression model to predict median housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

- 📥 Loaded the Boston Housing dataset  
- ➗ Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)  
- 🤖 Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn  
- 📊 Interpreted regression coefficients to understand feature importance  
- 📈 Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score  
- 🖼️ Visualized actual vs. predicted housing prices with a scatter plot  
- 💾 Saved the cleaned dataset and visualization screenshot for documentation

## 📁 Files Included

- `task3_linear_regression.ipynb` (or `.py`): Complete code and implementation for the task  
- `cleaned_boston_housing.csv`: The dataset used (cleaned and ready for modeling)  
- `screenshots/actual_vs_predicted.png`: Scatter plot image comparing actual vs. predicted prices

## ▶️ How to Run

- Open and execute the notebook or script (`task3_linear_regression.ipynb` or `.py`) to reproduce the entire workflow: data loading, training, evaluation, and visualization.  
- Review the saved outputs for detailed analysis and insights.
