# Task 3: Linear Regression – Boston Housing Price Prediction

**Name:** Joy Biswas

## Overview
This task implements a multiple linear regression model to predict median housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded Boston Housing dataset.
- Split data into training and testing sets (80-20).
- Trained a Linear Regression model.
- Interpreted regression coefficients (feature importance).
- Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and R² score.
- Visualized actual vs predicted prices.
- Saved the cleaned dataset and visualization screenshot.

## Files included
- `task3_linear_regression.ipynb` (or `.py`): Code for the task.
- `cleaned_boston_housing.csv`: The dataset used (no extra cleaning).
- `screenshots/actual_vs_predicted.png`: Scatter plot of results.

## How to Run
Execute the notebook/script to reproduce training, evaluation, and visualization.
