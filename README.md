# AI & ML Internship Repository

Welcome to my AI & ML Internship repository where I document and submit daily tasks as part of the Elevate AI & ML Internship program.

## Repository Structure

Each task is organized into its own folder named by task number:

- **Task1/** - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
  Contains code, datasets, visualizations, and explanations for data cleaning tasks.

- **Task2/** - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  Includes code, cleaned datasets, summary statistics, and visualizations related to exploratory data analysis.

- **Task3, Task4, ...**  
  Future tasks will follow the same pattern for easy tracking and review.
