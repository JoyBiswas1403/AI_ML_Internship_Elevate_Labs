# AI & ML Internship Repository

Welcome to my AI & ML Internship repository where I document and submit daily tasks as part of the Elevate AI & ML Internship program.

---

## Repository Structure

Each task is organized into its own folder named by task number:

- **Task1/** - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
  Contains code, datasets, visualizations, and explanations related to data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.

- **Task2/** - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  Includes code, cleaned datasets, summary statistics, and visualizations related to exploratory data analysis.

- **Task3/** - Linear Regression  
  Contains implementation of linear regression models, evaluation metrics, plots, and cleaned datasets.

- **Task4, Task5, ...**  
  Future tasks will follow the same organized pattern for easy tracking, submission, and review.

## What You Will Find Here

- Well-commented Python/Jupyter Notebook or script files for each internship task.
- Cleaned datasets used or generated during each task.
- Plots, screenshots, visualizations, and other media stored in their respective task folders.
- Summary reports and documentation in `README.md` files within each task folder.
- This main `README.md` provides an overview and navigation guide for the entire project.

## How to Use This Repository

- Navigate into the relevant task folder (e.g., `Task1/`, `Task2/`, `Task3/`) to access the code and outputs for that task.
- Follow the instructions and run the notebooks/scripts to reproduce the results.
- Review the images and CSV files provided to understand the findings and cleaned data.
- Read the task-specific README files in each folder for detailed explanations of the approach, tools used, and results.
- Feel free to explore the repository structure for easy access and organization of all internship tasks.
