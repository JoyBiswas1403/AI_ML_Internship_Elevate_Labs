## 📊 Dataset: Iris

- Generated and saved summary statistics as a CSV file (`summary_statistics.csv`) 📈  
- Plotted histograms and boxplots for all numeric features (saved in `screenshots/`) 🖼️  
- Created a pairplot and correlation heatmap for feature relationships 🔍  
- Cleaned dataset and original saved as `cleaned_iris_dataset.csv` 📂

## ✅ Task Checklist

1. **📥 Load and explore the Iris dataset**  
2. **📊 Generate summary statistics and save as CSV**  
3. **📉 Plot histograms and boxplots for numeric features**  
4. **🔗 Create pairplot to visualize feature relationships**  
5. **🎨 Generate correlation heatmap**  
6. **💾 Save cleaned data and all visualizations**

## 📝 How to Use This Project

1. Open and run `task2_eda.ipynb` (or `.py`) to reproduce all analyses and plots. ▶️  
2. Explore the generated CSV files (`summary_statistics.csv` and `cleaned_iris_dataset.csv`) for detailed data info.  
3. View the images saved in the `screenshots/` folder to study visualizations. 🖼️  
4. Use these outputs for further modeling or report writing.
